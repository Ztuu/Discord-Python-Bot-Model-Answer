# Discord Bot in Python Model Answer
This is a basic discord bot created by completing the tasks in [this exercise](TBD).

The bot has the following commands:
* !test - A test command to check the bot is functioning. It should reply "test successful" in the same channel.
* !hello - The bot replies "Hello \@username".
* !compliment - The bot will compliment the user who typed this command.
* !guess *number* - A random number guessing game. The bot generates a random
number between 1 and 100 and compares it to the users guess.
* !meow - Sends a cat picture.
* The bot will also greet users who come online with a compliment.
